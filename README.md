## UBC GPA Calculator

A simple script for UBC students to log in to the Student Service Centre and calculate their GPA (since UBC only provides percentage-based averages).

GPA calculation takes into consideration credit weight for each course, and allows users to choose between a 4.0 or 4.33 scale.

CWL login credentials are required to access grades in the Student Service Centre.
